                    I'm a student at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, NJ, doing a double major in Computer Engineering and Computer Science, and a minor in Math. I am interested in internship opportunites in the technology fields, specifically in Financial Tech, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering.

                            Since I started coding in 8th grade, I've built a <strong>website for a local non-profit</strong>, helped <strong>organize two hackathons</strong>,  built and coded my team's <strong>World Championship-level robot</strong>, led a group to generate a machine-learning based <strong>stock market volatility prediction model</strong>, and am going to be doing research with a <strong>self-driving pipeline-inspection robot</strong>. I have experience working in Java and Python (especially NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn for data analytics).

                            In addition, I have been playing <strong>piano for 10+ years</strong>, with solo and group experience. My favorite pieces to play are <strong>Beethoven's Tempest Sonata</strong>, and <strong>Chopin's Ballade #1</strong> (at least the parts of which I can play). I'm currently studying Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata, and Chopin's Black Key Etude,  in addition to other smaller pieces.
