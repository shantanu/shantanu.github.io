                            <li>Used NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn to import economic data from The St. Louis Federal Reserve Database (FRED) and run analysis.</li>

                        <h2>Paper Abstract: </h2>
                        <blockquote>The unpredictability of domestic financial markets negatively affects millions of Americans on a daily basis. This paper proposes a predictive model for volatility in the S&P 500 stock index based on the Elastic Net regression algorithm. For the purposes of this analysis, market volatility is defined as the residual of any day’s average S&P 500 value from the 200 day moving market trend. The data generated by this definition of volatility serves as a historical training set, on which the Elastic Net regression algorithm can train. This algorithm mathematically relates an array of economic indicators, which serve as a holistic and quantifiable representation of economic conditions in the United States, to generated values of historical volatility. After this training process, the Elastic Net algorithm generates a predictive model for S&P 500 volatility that has a standardized mean squared error of 0.2300 and predicts an increase in volatility over the next three months. Because the model is trained on a data set that is updated daily, the model can be utilized in the future to predict volatility as well.</blockquote>
