                        <li>Combination Lock - Designed a combination lock as a state machine with JK Flip Flops that would unlock to a 12-bit segment of my RUID number.</li>
                        <li>Pseudorandom Number Generator - Created a state machine using JK Flip Flops responding to a manual clock, outputting a numbers from a preset pseudorandom sequence.</li>
                        <li>4-bit Arithmetic Unit - Built a circuit unit able to perform addition, two's complement subtraction, increment, and decrement of 4-bit binary numbers. Completed using input switches, 4:1 Multiplexers, and a 4-bit binary adder. One number input was kept fixed, while the other was inputted through switches. Another set of switches toggled selection of arithmetic operation.</li>
                        <li>3-bit Binary to Grey code Convertor - Created a circuit where 3 switches of input binary were processed through multiplexers and XOR gates, outputting the corresponding grey code number.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Built a Myo Armband and Arduino-based Rock Paper Scissors player that will detect your movements and beat you. It is the first step towards more complex EMG analysis, and an inspirational tool to help students see the potential of tech.</li>
                        <li>A Myo is a device worn around your forearm that can read your motion and muscle signals. We used the Myo to differentiate between the three gestures we use in rock-paper-scissors.</li>
                        <li>Once the motion is detected and classified by the Myo, this data is relayed to an Arduino Uno. Each player gesture corresponds to an IO pin which gets the signal to rotate the winning servo arm; we made one arm for each play position: rock, paper, and scissors.</li>

                    <h3>Paper Abstract: </h3>
                    <blockquote>The unpredictability of domestic financial markets negatively affects millions of Americans on a daily basis. This paper proposes a predictive model for volatility in the S&P 500 stock index based on the Elastic Net regression algorithm. For the purposes of this analysis, market volatility is defined as the residual of any day’s average S&P 500 value from the 200 day moving market trend. The data generated by this definition of volatility serves as a historical training set, on which the Elastic Net regression algorithm can train. This algorithm mathematically relates an array of economic indicators, which serve as a holistic and quantifiable representation of economic conditions in the United States, to generated values of historical volatility. After this training process, the Elastic Net algorithm generates a predictive model for S&P 500 volatility that has a standardized mean squared error of 0.2300 and predicts an increase in volatility over the next three months. Because the model is trained on a data set that is updated daily, the model can be utilized in the future to predict volatility as well.</blockquote>
